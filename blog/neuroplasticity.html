        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> comes with a lot of benefits, and it allows our brain to adapt and change. Research shows that it helps promote the ability to learn 
            new things and to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities. It’s also been proven to help in the rehabilitation for those who suffered from strokes 
            and traumatic brain injuries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can give people a whole new perspective. It puts us away from a “trapped” kind of thinking, and enables 
            us to enhance or change the way we think and approach things. There’s a wide yet to be known possibilities that Neuroplasticity can bring. I think that 
            learning that principles can also build our confidence and resilience, during the not knowing season.
        </p>
        <h3>How I will engage with the principles of Neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
            I will embrace the broad unknown, and welcome challenges that will allow development and growth. Believe in 1% improvement principle - that little efforts and little 
            things can make up big results so that I can improve not only in building habits, but also growing what I am learning by practicing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practicing what I'm learning will definitely help build a good foundation. I also think that connecting with people around me to reflect on what I'm learning and gaining better context of it, 
            are ways that can increase neuroplasticity. Another way I think is by continuing to do what's called "White Spacing," which is about taking strategic pause. I found it really helpful
            in improving my ability to change and adapt, and in building resilience.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a resource I found useful to summarise the concept of Neuroplasticity and how it can shape the way we learn.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain skills, their abilities aren’t set in stone. 
            They think that with work, their skills can improve over time. For me it's also knowing that anything outside of our comfort zone, is a great moment. This is really relevant especially in our modern world, 
            faced with a pandemic. Having a growth mindset will set us up to see that even challenges are opportunities to grow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In exploring these concepts, I was able to reflect on how I am right now, and what steps I could take to further improve and grow a <em>Growth Mindset</em> within me. I think that this helped me to think that I should 
            embrace challenges more, and allow it to shape and develop me. This also tells me to be a "wow person", not a "how person" to myself and others. IHaving a growth mindset will definitely help in shaping the 
            way I learn, and becoming better at it.
