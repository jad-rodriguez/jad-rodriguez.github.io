        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Long Term Goal and/or Career Pathway</h3>
        <p>
            Before I went to this course, I already had a dream to bring some of my ideas to life. I knew I need to learn coding and programming, 
            and getting into this course is really a great jumpstart to progressing towards reaching those dreams. I think for starter, I’d really 
            look into honing my dev skills, so I’ll probably get into a career in the industry, find hopefully somewhere to begin and be able to grow even further. 
            On the side hopefully, I’d be able to develop the idea I have in mind for an app.
        </p>
        <h3>Human Skills I'd like to see developed in me while at EDA</h3>
        <p>
            I'm really excited to see myself develop and grow further in all aspect of human skills that can be learned throughout the programme. 
        </p>
        <h3>More about my Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            In case you haven’t checked yet, I’ve posted my Gallup Strengths Insight Report in the Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration page. 
            The 5 main themes of my strengths are strategic, maximiser, ideation, developer, and positivity. I can really observe myself as someone who is strategic. 
            I really try my best to plan and sort things out in a structured manner, especially when it comes to working with others. I am also a big believer in 
            focusing on strengths to stimulate personal and group excellence. I once was involved in a project that aimed to improve operational excellence in the 
            company I’ve previously worked for, and found it was a real joy for me. Discussing ideas and brainstorming excites me as well. I love it when I talk to 
            people, and suddenly get a bulb light moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            At times though, I have the tendency to become hyperfocused that I wanted to get things done, but forget the balance of things. 
            I think it’s also a result of putting a lot of pressure on to my self, sometimes being too hard on myself. But I try to manage, 
            and maintain a good balance. As someone who's also just been here to New Zealand, and relatively new to the culture, I kinda still see myself 
            learning to become better immersed and well-conscious of how the culture is general. I see this as a possible limitation, but definitely an exciting part of my learning journey.
        </p>
        <h3>Managing Workloads</h3>
        <p>
            In terms of managing my workload in this programme, I will do my best to commit to planning and mapping the items I need to work on. Make sure that I do it in a timely manner, 
            and discuss when I need more time. I will continue to employ the strategies I’ve found effective for me, like the Pomodo technique and focus funneling. 
            I will also make sure to conduct myself professionally, and with respect for others, whilst also not taking the fun away in dealing with my co-learners, 
            facilitators, and industry/community reps.
        </p>
        <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
        <p>
            If I found myself needing to reach out for help, I will do my best to do so in a timely manner, and contact the right people to get help from. 
            I’ll utilise the platforms there are available in reaching out for help, such as the slack channels, or direct message to my facilitator if need be.  
        </p>
        <h3>Expectations from the Facilitation Team</h3>    
        <p>
            I am hoping that the facilitation team will be supportive and easily approachable to access help. I look forward to getting insightful feedback from them.
        </p>

                Whilst also going through the programme, I try to balance my time so I’d really be able to get white space, and spend time with my wife.
