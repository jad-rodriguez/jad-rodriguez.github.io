        <p>Hi, I'm Jad :)</p>
        <p>
        I was born and raised in the Philippines. I came to New Zealand in July 2019. Just a fun fact: 
        I got held up and was the last person to go out of the final check because I brought dried fish (one the most popular food back home), 
        which needs to be checked through biosecurity.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I got a degree in Psychology but loved working in the fun corporate world so I've been in Learning and Development most of my careeer in the Philippines. 
        When I got here, I opened myself up to the massive opportunity there is and got myself into mostly healthcare roles, which I found an awesome experience! 
        Super loving it here! 
        </p>
        <p>When I learned about this opportunity at Enspiral Dev Academy, I really thought this is the one that I've been looking for. 
        I got interested with web dev and tech, when I got involved with a small start up company in the Philippines called FourPoint.Zero. 
        Since then, I try to think about some ideas around apps and stuff, and thought maybe I can make it happen someday.
        This opportunity is such a massive opening for me to be able to bring life to some of the ideas I have in mind (hopefully).
        That's just a dream for now, but hey this blog mainly is part of my learning journey with Enspiral Dev Academy. This is my first step towards that.
        This blog page will house the works that I will be doing throughout the Foundations Course, and it's really exciting!
        </p>
        <p>If you wanna learn a bit more about me, I've put a link under "Learn more about Jad" section below.<br>
        It's a page I created through Google Site template, so don't be surprised it's way awesome than this one (lol).<br>
        Don't worry, I'll try my best to make this look flash as I go along :)<br>
        </p>
        <p>Join me in this journey and have fun browsing through my page. Cheers!</p>
