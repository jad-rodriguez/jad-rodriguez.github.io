        <h3>Personal Core Values</h3>
        <p>
            I started my corporate career as a Training Staff for a retail company. As part of my role, I conduct regular auditing of all our stores.
            There was one time when I was assigned to do an audit for one of our strongest stores nationwide, and it so happen that at the time I was there, 
            the Operations Manager was also present for some business. I've found several violations and sub-standard practices based on the criteria that I 
            need to check, and the results showed that it was a fail. As part of the process, I spoke to the Store Head to inform about the findings, and this 
            immediately reached the attention of the Operations Manager who was also there at that time. I knew it's going a big deal and will be part of what I 
            need to be prepared to prove and discuss when I submit the results in the head office.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wasn't surprised to learn that there was a big discussion in the ManCom meeting about it because the results of the audit would mean that the team wouldn't 
            receive incentives, and will reflect an overall score for the company (being a franchise for an international brand). Prior that, I was told to adjust the scores 
            and be considerate about some of the items they thought is not a big deal to give a pass. I was just relatively new in the company, and it would have gained me 
            a good impression with the Operations Manager, if I adjust the scores to let them pass the audit. Even if it took me a lot of nasty feedback and not-so-good standing 
            with members of the operations team, I maintained and have proven that it was an objective process, and that the results were plainly based on what has been found 
            during the audit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst it wasn't pleasant to hear people talking about me regarding that situation, I was really glad that I gained the confidence of the company's owner in doing 
            what is necessary, just, and right, even if it will cost us also as a company. I believe that doing the right thing even if it's unpopular, and not what others would 
            take objectively, it will always be worth standing for, but in a respectful, professional, and humane manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been raised in a Christian family, but it doesn't mean that I am any "holier than thou" kind of person. I also have my weaknesses, failures, and have made mistakes. 
            I think how it shaped me was mainly having that passion for God, and compassion for people. A lot of how I am as a person was shaped with what I what I've grown to believe in. 
            At the same time, I also learn and keep on learning to see the real world around me, maintain a balance in my perspective, and really give value to other people's beliefs, opinions, 
            and experiences. It has also opened me up to a really friendly environment, and I think it has really impacted me a lot. I love to connect with people, and try my best to be someone 
            who will serve as an encouragement to the people around me.
        </p>
        <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            Back in 2019, I've been able to get myself a Strength's Finder assessment, which I found really helpful in navigating my strengths. You can check the full results here:
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                The 5 main themes of my strengths are <strong>strategic</strong>, <strong>maximiser</strong>, <strong>ideation</strong>, <strong>developer</strong>, and <strong>positivity</strong>. 
                Even without telling the people closest to me about these results, I've been able to confirm with them that these indeed are my probably main strenghts. When I deal with anything, I really try to think it through, 
                especially if it requires it. And I think I've been used to kind of map in my mind what am gonna do, and it has been quite a mental mondel that's embedded in me. Like going through this course, I try to plan for 
                my schedules and the things I need to do, and strategise accordingly. So far, it's been effective! I love sharing ideas, and work with others in making an idea glow. I've done several projects back in my previous job 
                in the Phillippines, and has been able to contribute in creating an online platform for the company's retail learning and development team. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe these strengths are really what I am able to utilise even as go through problems along the way. I've shared in one of my reflections about how I try to go through problems, and am gonna share it with you here as well.

            <h4>How I try to solve problems or issues?</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 1</strong>: <em>Define</em> - I cannot solve what I don't define, and it's important to be clear about what the problem really is. Analyze and process the problem, so I know what I should do next.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>: <em>Problem Funneling</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can I easily do the GAGA technique (Google And Get Answer)?</li>
                    <li>Complex and Requiring Focus or Concentration?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Divide to sub-problems</li>
                            <li>Start with simple and move towards the complex</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Can I Pass on Purpose? </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it looks like it's something I can list down and come back to, and is non-urgent (could be something that will make sense as I go along and will work itself out), then I'll just put it on my list and go back to check.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Time to Partner with Someone?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If I've exhausted all my options and still stuck with the same problem, it does mean I need to check-in with someone to find out solution</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I try to employ this kind of strategy as I go along and found it really helpful to ease the pressure I have when I face issues or problems going through the modules. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think in terms of my limitations, I sometimes struggle with being too hyperfocused. As someone who loves to dive in immediately to get things done, I really found myself 
                being pressured, because I wanted to get things done, when I can actually be more relaxed. What helps combat this is going back to my strategies and remembering that I should take it easy, be easy with myself, 
                and enjoy the journey. Another one is how sometimes I get critical about myself. Really, sometimes I struggle about being too hard on myself. I guess it's rooting from expectations I am putting on to myself. 
                I try to remind myself about the concept of <em>progress not perfection</em>. It's really a good reminder that as I journey, I should look at even just 1% improvements I made. There's really much greater transformation 
                when we allow 1% imporvements to accummulate overtime, as it creates a rather lasting impact. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><em>"Do not despise the small things."</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember a time when I had a meeting with a team, and it was being run by our Manager. There was a project that we were planning for, and in one of the specific items assigned to me, 
                I was advised to take a 10-hour bus travel for one of my runs, when there is actually a flight I could take and will bring me to the training location in less than an hour. I found that it wasn't making sense, 
                so I try to discuss about changing the plan to get the flight instead of the bus, as the cost and efficiency is rather better when I take the flight. The manager was really adamant about it, as he wanted to prove a case 
                which I thought could plainly be discussed in terms of presentation without having someone to actually do it. As he seem to be really adamant, I've just shared my thoughts and discuss it also with our Senior Manager. I've learned that 
                it was just a decision made by the manager, and wasn't an approved one yet. So I sat down with them to discuss about my thoughts, and we were able to reach an agreement to get me to a flight instead of the bus ride.
            </p>
            <p>
                This wasn't about who's wrong or right. I think the main thing here is being able to confront issues of resistance or tension, in a professional manner. It is uncomfortable, a lot of times awkward, but conflicts are good opportunities to create 
                better relationships, when dealt in the right manner. I'd say, when there is tension or resistance, I'll try to reach out and discuss in the best way I can, but if it's something that would require intervention, then I think it would be best to reach out 
                to someone who can help.
