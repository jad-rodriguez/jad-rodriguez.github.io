        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Have you ever had a time when you were faced with a problem, and can't figure out how to get through, 
            but all of a sudden realise the answer is actually just one google away?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Hey, you're not alone! This week was loaded with problems to solve. So I've been working my way through the challenges
            which requires us to code and pass each tests with varying degrees of difficulties. One of the things I noticed I was struggling
            with was the thought that I didn't have much context to what the error is trying to tell me. When something is wrong with the code 
            there will be prompts telling me what the error is based on the test that needs to be passed. I thought that the lack of context
            was mainly that the error message was not elaborate enough to guide me through what I need to do. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, the GAGA (Google and Get Answer) technique has been super handy this week! I feel like I should now call it GAGA Power!
            But before going into it, breaking down the problems and trying to navigate the error has helped me to formulate a way to approach 
            the problem. Before going into Google and writing the code, it's been helpful to try and put into words what exactly it is I need 
            to code. This is called Pseudocoding. In other times, I found it helpful to reach out and talk to someone to help make sense of 
            what I need to do to solve the problem. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The process of going through the problem was kinda the feeling of climbing up a steep mountain with anticipation to descend after. 
            It was kinda overwhelming at some point but breaking down the problem, and trying to understand the error, with the use of GAGA 
            power, has helped a lot in navigating the problem to come up with solution. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey has been packed with so much lessons to learn, especially in the area of solving problems. I think I actually gained 
            a better understanding of being comfortable in the uncomfortable situation kind of thing. Having the right perspective and mindset 
            is really important in dealing with problems. And of course, the GAGA power is always handy!
        </p>

        <h3>Reflections about Problem Solving Techniques and Process</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is such a helpful technique to try and break down problems. It also helps in coming up with steps to take in solving the 
            problems. I believe I have been able to make use of this technique effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Trying something</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Coding is a lot of trial and error for me at this stage, and I think I have made use of this a lot in the process. It's really 
            important to try and check if the codes I can think of will actually work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I used to talk to myself while trying to make sense of the errors, and clues I have to come up with codes. This has been quite a 
            handy technique to try and process thoughts, whilst also coming up with solutions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Reading Error Messages</strong>
        </p> 
        <p>
            I think this is really quite a challenging one for me. At first I really feel like for those that are quite complex to code, I 
            thought I have very limited context, but eventually as I go along, I could see that reading error messages and the tests help in 
            getting a better understanding of what needs to be done. This should also be done with googling technique. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            By far, I have been trying to incorporate this more in the way I try to solve problems. I feel like most of the time I am focused 
            in actually trying the codes to be able to pass the test, and forget that console.logging is actually an effective way to check the 
            codes I am trying. I will try to better at using this technique more often. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Googling</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is by far the technique I'd say I am really confident I've used a lot and effectively! Like I said in my previous blogs, the GAGA 
            (Google and Get Answer) technique was a good friend of mine in coding. As I said I shall now call it the GAGA power! Most of the answers 
            I need are pretty much available, and easy to work out finding just by Googling some key words. Definitely using more and more of this!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Asking Peers and Coaches For Help</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As there's been quite a good amount of conversations happening via Slack, I found that the same problems I have been facing were 
            pretty much being brought up and a lot of helpful hints were also given. I think this is also one area I need to be better at, but 
            I guess I'd really want more like an acutal interaction, and so I'd prefer to speak to someone when reaching out for help. 
            When I get my Wednesday's with Naomi check-in schedule, I bring up whatever concerns I have, and found it really helpful. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I love reflecting and it's really helpful to look back with the steps I've taken to further improve the way I solve problems. 
            I always remember a concept I've learned to try and look at 5 steps ahead, backwards, and sidewards when trying to come up with 
            solutions. I think this is always embedded in my processes.
