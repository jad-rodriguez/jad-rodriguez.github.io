        <h2>Reflections on My Fooundations Journey</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <strong><em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I found that I am becoming more aware of when I am starting to be frustrated about something, and that most times it can be solved by 
            taking a pause, and zoning out a bit. I saw that my frustration was kind of rooting from the desire to get things done within prescribed time, 
            but I always remind myself how important the process and journey is. I also learned to better reflect on what I'm doing and what I've been 
            learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that they propel us to learn optimally and meaningfully. Values, emphaty, and self awareness sort of drive the way we approach 
            learning and programming. It helps shape and develop ourselves in the process, whilst learning technical stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I guess it's the development of conscious awareness and experience of how it serves as a great complement to learning technical stuff. 
            It helped me in developing a frame of mind in the way I approach learning and developing myself in the process. And I found it an important 
            part of my foundation journey. Definitely helped me further improve the way I learn and understand myself better. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd say that the core aspect was actually a pleasure than a challenge for me. They're very useful and effective in shaping the way I am learning. 
            To be honest, I can't think of anything that I found challenging in the aspects of core learning. I place high value in what I've learned through it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is definitely an important aspect of shaping us, students. Much of how we can perform, are for sure linked in most of what we have covered in 
            the core aspect throughout the Foundation journey. I think of it in summary as “being precedes doing.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise 
            programming instead? Justify your answer.</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Definitely not! It was such an important aspect of the journey. I wouldn’t have it any other way. It made such a huge impact in developing myself 
            in the process. 
        </p>
